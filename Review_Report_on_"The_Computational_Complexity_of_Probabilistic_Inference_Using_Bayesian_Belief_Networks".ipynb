        "The paper first introduce the Bayesian belief network and probabilistic inference, then prove the probabilistic inference in multiply connected networks is a 'NP-hard' problem, by transforming a NP-complete problem '3-SAT 'problem to a Decision-problem version of Probabilistic Inference using belief networks, then proving the transformed problem is NP-hard.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bayesian belief network is a probabilistic graphical representation which can represent probabilistic relationships concisely. The belief network can consider only the known dependencies among all the variables thus can be used for a lot of expert systems such as medical diagnosis.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we build a belief network, each node in the network is only affected by other connected nodes in the up layer, so that the computing of the conditional probability for a specific node will be much fewer than before.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since belief networks provide more efficient method for representing probabilistic dependencies among a set of variables, a lot of researchers are exploring the use of belief networks in artificial intelligence. However, for some complex domains, multiply connected networks are essential. If the problem is proved to be NP-hard, looking for an exact algorithm for the computing will be extremely difficult.\n",
        "\n",
        "3SAT is a known NP-complete problem. This paper reduced the 3SAT problem to a Decision-problem version of Probabilistic Inference using Belief networks (PIBNETD), then using the construction and the definition of belief networks coming up to a conclusion, that any instance of 3SAT can be reduced to PIBNETD,  thus PIBNETD is NP-Hard. From the transformation, we know that PIBNETD is both NP-hard and in NP, so the PIBNETD is NP-complete. \n",
        "After that, the author transformed the PIBNETD problem to probabilistic inference problem, PIBNET, which is a computational version of PIBNET. So PIBNETD is able to be transformed to PIBNET under the specific condition, so PIBNET is NP-hard.\n",
        "\n",
        "After proving that probabilistic inference using belief networks is NP-hard, we now know that developing an exact algorithm for probabilistic inference using belief network will not work.\n",
        "Base on the conclusion, the researech for the application of Bayesian belief network should focus on other solution instead of searching for a general algorithm.\n",

        "\n",
        "The main innovation of this paper is the successful proving process using a known problem '3SAT' and the transformation to prove that this known NP-complete problem can be reduced to the problem we discussed, thus it came with a conclusion that probabilistic inference using belief networks is NP-hard. \n",
        "\n",
        "Finding out if the problem belongs to P/NP/NPC/NPH problem will determine if we are able to find an exact algorithm which can solve or verify the problem in polynomial time. \n",
        "\n",
        "As been proved, probabilistic inference using some specific types of belief networks which is restricted can be performed efficiently. However, in the some domains like medicine or medical diagnosis, always need a large multiply connected network. For multiply connected networks with uninstantiated variables, after it is proved to be a NP-hard problem, we would know a general, exact, efficient solution may not exist, therefore the following researchers should not spend much time on developing such an algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the discussion part of the paper, after proving the problem is NP-hard, the author also provided several algorithm might work and the possible solution to the future development in belief network as well, such like the Approximation algorithms using an inexact solution but set an error bounds for the accuracy, which may be the future solution and will greatly inspire the following researchers.  \n",
        "\n",
        "With the contribution of this paper, as suggested by the author, we should use different strategies to solve this kind problems in the future, which means the following researchers should focus on developing a computationally algorithm instead of looking for a general, exact algorithm.\n",

        "\n",
        "I think the quality of this article is high. The purpose of the paper is to prove this problem is NP-Hard. Based on the previous research, we have already got a definition about NP-Hard problem and several problems which have already been proved to be NP-complete problems. And the author used the previous works from others, chose the suitable research, made a complex conversion from a known NP-complete problem to a probabilistic inference using belief networks and successfully finished the work.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the proving process, there are several problems which have already been proved to be NP-complete.All of them can be reduced to PIBNET. The author choose 3SAT among them, which provides a  simple proof. At the same time, it demonstrates that even for belief networks that are significantly restricted topologically, PIBNET is NP-hard as well. Meanwhile restricted versions of 3SAT is NP-complete, and  restrictions can be used to derive direct corresponding restrictions for probabilistic inference using belief networks. Thus, by using 3SAT in the proving process, the paper also derived additional complexity results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, based on the conclusion, that probabilistic inference using belief networks is NP-hard, the following researchers would pay more attention on other direction which is the design of efficient special-case, average-case, and approximation algorithms. The paper has been cited for more than 2660 times according to google scholar.\n",

        "Above all, I think the quality of the paper is high."

        "In my opinion, the proposed technique mentioned by the paper is appropriate for the machine learning application domain. The theory in the paper is related to bayesian belief network and NP-hard problems, which are based on bayesian algorithm and time complexity of the algorithm. Bayesian algorithm is one of the most popular algorithms in this area, and time complexity is a essential factor in all the computer science domain. Therefore, the research work can not only be applied in this domain, but also be useful in other domains related to bayesian network.\n",
        "\n",
        "Under the conclusion of this paper, For the further developments of the research work, we can look for other applications to bayesian network base on the conclusion of this paper. And since the exact abduction in a network is NP-hard, we can focus on inexact or approximate reasoning and algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "During reading this paper, I found the P/NP/NPC problems are really interesting. Proving P = NP is one of the most popular unsolved problems even till now. Also since we cannot find an exact algorithm for the belief network, I am looking forward to finding out how other researchers develop other inexact, bounded solution to make it able to solve the real problem in the real world by using belief network such like the medical diagnose model right now. \n",

The structure of the paper is clear enough for me, as a beginner of this domain, to understand what the author wants to introduce in each section of the paper. The author first provided enough introduction for all the knowledge which would be used in the following part, including the definition of belief networks, probabilistic inference, 3SAT problems.\n",
        " One thing can be improved about presentation of the paper, in my opinion, is the quality of the figure. Only one figure was provided during the whole paper and it has been used for several times from the introduction to the proving process, which makes it a bit confused with several elements not introduced at the beginning but being explained in the middle of the paper."
